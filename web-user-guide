# Introduction to the MyUHD Manage Classes Tile
> This is the markdown version of an exerpt from my MadCap Flare-based user guides for the
University of Houston-Downtownâ€™s Oracle PeopleSoft student portal.
**Manage Classes** is the third tile in the myUHD Student Home. Here, you can
enroll, view your classes, and plan courses.
The page heading lists your current selected semester, degree type
